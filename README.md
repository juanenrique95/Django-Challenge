Django and Django RestFramework Coding Challenge for API developer candidates

Hello, and welcome to the Django coding challenge! You'll find a set of instructions below that you must attempt to complete within 3 days. Clone this repository to start the challenge, and good luck! When completed, push your solution to a new repository, and send us a link.

Within this repository, you will find a simple application with the ability to create and list accounts.

Here are some things we need help with:

We have create, list and retrieve features but lack the ability to update. Introduce a new `PUT` endpoint at api/v1/accounts/{id} that receives a JSON body containing phone, shipping_address1, shipping_address2, shipping_city, shipping_state, shipping_zip,
shipping_country. The feature should update the existing record and return a JSON body representing the new state of the account item.

Also add a way to filter accounts by `shipping_country` in the admin interface

Besides write a view responding to a GET to path /api/v1/fizz-buzz/x=25 that will write the results of running FizzBuzz program for numbers from 1 to x. 
Looping them but for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. If the number is not divisible for three or five write the number.
As you can see x is a querystring param and by default this number should be 100. The response will be a json with the following format:

{"x": 100, "fizzbuzz": "here comes the result of your algorithm"}

You may notice the lack of tests in the repo, maybe set a good example and add tests to your method if you have time. That way the other devs can copy-paste from your good example. Once done, go ahead and open a pull request again the repo.

Good luck again.
